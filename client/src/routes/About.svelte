<h1>About</h1>
<p>I’ve never been the “healthy type”, and I couldn’t understand the “gym
bunnies” in spite of wanting to be a doctor at a young age to see people
healthy.</p>
<p>However, as I got older, I started to think more and more about my
health. I met so many people – younger and older – with diabetes,
cardiovascular diseases, arthritis, back pains and many other ailments
that it made me think. I realised how our lifestyle has a hugely negative
impact on our health. However, it was not enough for me to take action. I
looked at my diet and I felt that it was relatively healthy. I had my daily
physical activity while walking my dog. I had a stable weight – even
though I could do with a couple of kilograms less.</p>
<p>Then I started to suffer from gastro-related issues. I knew that I needed
to change my diet. However, since I was convinced that I ate healthily, a
mental blockage stopped me. As symptoms became worse, I often felt
lethargic, tired and even my concentration and memory were not the
same. When my sleep was compromised, I decided to seek guidance. I
still thought that I can deal with this by myself.</p>
<p>I was searching for information and a kind of support. When I read the
Health Coach Academy website, I knew that I found what I was looking
for. I joined the Academy to learn more about healthy lifestyle and to find
a way to “cure” myself. By this time, I had several medical investigations
with no definite diagnosis. At the back of my mind, I was also hoping that
if coaching works for me, I can try and help others.</p>
<p>It was one of the best decisions of my life. The course provided me with
everything I could wish for to change my lifestyle and become a
successful health and wellbeing coach; academic knowledge,
developing and nurturing the right mindset, aspiration, self-confidence,
guidance for constant development and best practices to serve my
clients.</p>
<p>I changed my diet and learnt to manage the symptoms of my IBS. I
became more aware of my food choices. It led to a more balanced blood
sugar level that resulted in more energy and better mood. I never had to
think twice about going out for a walk. The daily three walks – during the
week with work, I get up at 5.30am to have my morning 45 minutes with
my dog, I take half an hour for my lunch time walk and, in the evening, I
walk with my dog after dinner – became something that I look forward to.</p>
<p>I realised that I stopped craving sweets as I used to, so there was no
need for snacking anymore. Although, I don’t say no to some nuts now
and then or a piece of dark chocolate once in a while, but they are not
part of my daily routine.</p>
<p>It seemed that my new lifestyle energized me, and I regained my once
famously good memory. I had that lovely feeling of achievement and
contentment!</p>
<p>At 57 I feel capable again!</p>

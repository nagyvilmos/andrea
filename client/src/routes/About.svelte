<h1>My Story</h1>

    <p>
        When I was younger, I always wanted to be a doctor. Even though I always
        wanted to see others healthy and happy, I myself never had a healthy
        lifestyle.
    </p>
    <p>
        As years passed, I started to think more about my health. I met so many
        people – younger and older – with diabetes, cardiovascular diseases,
        arthritis, back pains and many other ailments that made me think. I
        realised how my lifestyle had a hugely negative impact on my health.
        However, this realisation was not enough for me to take action. I looked
        at my diet and I felt that it was relatively healthy. I had my daily
        physical activity while walking my dog. I had a stable weight – even
        though I could do with a couple of kilograms less. So, I felt that I was
        doing well.
    </p>
    <p >
        Then I started to suffer from gastro-related issues. I knew that I
        needed to change. Regarding my diet, I was convinced that I ate
        healthily, even though I realised that there were some types of meals
        that made me feel bloated and very uncomfortable. This category
        contained foods such as wholemeal products, garlic, oranges, grapes.
        However, I regarded these as healthy foods, so a mental blockage stopped
        me from changing. As symptoms became worse, I often felt lethargic and
        even my concentration and memory were not the same. When my sleep was
        compromised, I decided to seek guidance. I still thought that I can deal
        with this by myself.
    </p>
    <p>
        I was searching for information and some kind of support. When I read
        the Health Coach Academy website, I knew that I found what I was looking
        for. I joined the Academy to learn more about healthy lifestyle and to
        find a way to “cure” myself. By this time, I had several medical
        investigations with no definite diagnosis. At the back of my mind, I was
        also hoping that if coaching works for me, I can try and help others.
    </p>
    <p>
        It was one of the best decisions of my life. The course provided me with
        everything I could wish for to change my lifestyle and become a
        successful health and wellbeing coach; academic knowledge, developing
        and nurturing the right mindset, aspiration, self-confidence, guidance
        for constant development and the best practices to serve my clients.

        I changed my diet and learnt to manage the symptoms of my IBS better. I
        became more aware of my food choices. It led to a more balanced blood
        sugar level that resulted in more energy and better mood. I never had to
        think twice about going out for a walk. The daily three walks became
        something that I look forward to. I realised that I stopped craving
        sweets as I used to, so there was no need for snacking anymore.
        Although, I don’t say no to some nuts now and then or a piece of dark
        chocolate once in a while, but they are not part of my daily routine.
    </p>
    <p>
        Learning about the different factors of a healthy lifestyle made me
        admit that stress management was as important to keeping my IBS at bay
        as my diet and exercise. With the help of coaching, I learnt to see the
        everyday joys of life - a smile, a chirping bird, the smell of the
        woods, clear sky, fresh air – and give thanks for what I have. Day by
        day it became easier to focus on the positives rather than the
        negatives.
    </p>
    <p>
        It seemed that my new lifestyle energized me, and I regained my once
        famously good memory. I slept better. And I had that feeling of
        achievement and contentment that were rare in my previous “life”! I feel
        that I managed to build the resilience I need to keep healthy and not
        worry about ageing.

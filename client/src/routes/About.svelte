<h1>My Story</h1>

<div class="half-width" >
    <p>
        When I was younger, I always wanted to be a doctor. Even though I always
        wanted to see others healthy and happy, I myself never had a healthy
        lifestyle.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
        As years passed, I started to think more about my health. I met so many
        people – younger and older – with diabetes, cardiovascular diseases,
        arthritis, back pains and many other ailments that made me think. I
        realised how my lifestyle had a hugely negative impact on my health.
        However, this realisation was not enough for me to take action. I looked
        at my diet and I felt that it was relatively healthy. I had my daily
        physical activity while walking my dog. I had a stable weight – even
        though I could do with a couple of kilograms less. So, I felt that I was
        doing well.
    </p>
    <p >
        Then I started to suffer from gastro-related issues. I knew that I
        needed to change. Regarding my diet, I was convinced that I ate
        healthily, even though I realised that there were some types of meals
        that made me feel bloated and very uncomfortable. This category
        contained foods such as wholemeal products, garlic, oranges, grapes.
        However, I regarded these as healthy foods, so a mental blockage stopped
        me from changing. As symptoms became worse, I often felt lethargic and
        even my concentration and memory were not the same. When my sleep was
        compromised, I decided to seek guidance. I still thought that I can deal
        with this by myself.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
        I was searching for information and some kind of support. When I read
        the Health Coach Academy website, I knew that I found what I was looking
        for. I joined the Academy to learn more about healthy lifestyle and to
        find a way to “cure” myself. By this time, I had several medical
        investigations with no definite diagnosis. At the back of my mind, I was
        also hoping that if coaching works for me, I can try and help others.
    </p>
    <p>
        It was one of the best decisions of my life. The course provided me with
        everything I could wish for to change my lifestyle and become a
        successful health and wellbeing coach; academic knowledge, developing
        and nurturing the right mindset, aspiration, self-confidence, guidance
        for constant development and the best practices to serve my clients.
    </p>
    <p >
        I changed my diet and learnt to manage the symptoms of my IBS better. I
        became more aware of my food choices. It led to a more balanced blood
        sugar level that resulted in more energy and better mood. I never had to
        think twice about going out for a walk. The daily three walks became
        something that I look forward to. I realised that I stopped craving
        sweets as I used to, so there was no need for snacking anymore.
        Although, I don’t say no to some nuts now and then or a piece of dark
        chocolate once in a while, but they are not part of my daily routine.
    </p>
    <p>
        Learning about the different factors of a healthy lifestyle made me
        admit that stress management was as important to keeping my IBS at bay
        as my diet and exercise. With the help of coaching, I learnt to see the
        everyday joys of life - a smile, a chirping bird, the smell of the
        woods, clear sky, fresh air – and give thanks for what I have. Day by
        day it became easier to focus on the positives rather than the
        negatives.
    </p>
    <p>
        It seemed that my new lifestyle energized me, and I regained my once
        famously good memory. I slept better. And I had that feeling of
        achievement and contentment that were rare in my previous “life”! I feel
        that I managed to build the resilience I need to keep healthy and not
        worry about ageing.

    <h2>My mission, vision, values statements</h2>
    <p>
        I believe that making an effort is worth it. Focusing on being aware of
        our health needs and addressing them always pays off. However, sometimes
        we need that little nudge to start, or the knowledge that someone is
        there to encourage and support us, making us accountable to continue. It
        makes that difference between a thought and an action. Suddenly, the
        health journey becomes joyful and pleasurable. That's my role as your
        health coach.
    </p>
    <p>
        I would love to be your companion on your health journey; encouraging
        the development of the right mindset to build up resilience and live
        your best life. I believe that making an effort is worth it. Focusing on
        being aware of our health needs and addressing them always pays off. It
        makes that difference between a thought and an action. To make it
        happen; that's my role as your health coach.
    </p>
    <p>
        My vision is to encourage and support as many people as possible to live
        healthier and happier.
    </p>
    <p>
        I want to make a difference; I want people of all ages to build
        resilience that will help them to strive in the face of adversity. I
        want to see children, young adults, middle aged people and elderly lead
        a heathier lifestyle that makes the Earth a happier place. I'm
        empathetic, compassionate, caring. I learnt to listen to people and use
        intuition to unleash potentials. I want to be a professional. I want
        health and wellbeing coaching to be my purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm successful because I'm good at coaching. I have clients and I have a
        waiting list. Clients like me because they feel that I care. I live up
        to my clients' expectations and I get new clients simply by having a
        good reputation. I run good programmes and offer packages that makes
        everyone feel they address their needs.
